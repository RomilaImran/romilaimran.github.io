        <h1>Investigating Whole-scalp Accuracy-specific Neural Correlates Underlying Reinforcement Learning</h1>
        
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            While the role of positive feedback in reinforcement learning (e.g., maintain strategy) is well-characterized, the exact function of negative (incorrect) feedback remains ambiguous, variously suggested to serve as performance monitoring, a signal for strategy change, or simply an inverted form of positive feedback. Resolving this ambiguity was a key goal. Second, existing research is limited by its heavy reliance on univariate Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), which overemphasize individual electrode activity and neglect complex, network-level brain processes that arise from several overlapping ERPs. Since learning is a dynamic and distributed task, this approach risks overlooking crucial signals. Therefore, the primary objective of this project was to overcome these methodological limitations by employing a multivariate, whole-scalp approach to identify distinct neural correlates for positive and negative feedback, and subsequently to correlate these specific neural signatures with the change in the learning rate to determine their functional relevance in adaptive learning.

            Multivariate neural signatures were deduced using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers, trained separately on correct and incorrect whole-scalp EEG activity to identify features best distinguishing between learning states on Day 1 and Day 3. The classifier worked by optimizing a hyperplane in sequential 70 ms time windows to maximize separation between the two days. The performance of this distinction was measured by the Az score (Area Under the ROC Curve); time points with high Az scores indicate a neural correlate where significant learning-related change occurred. The classifier's continuous output, the discriminant score (y), was extracted as the neural signature. These signatures were spatially interpreted using scalp maps derived from the classifier's weight vector (importance of each electrode) via Haufe's transformation over the -450 ms pre-response to 1000 ms post-response period.

            To quantify the behavioral aspect of learning, a Reinforcement Learning Drift-Diffusion Model (RLDDM) was employed, which extends the standard DDM to include the impact of feedback (Q-learning) on future decisions. This model estimated the learning rate for each participant, a core parameter quantifying a participant's responsiveness to reward. The behavioral measure of adaptive learning was calculated as the change in learning rate between Day 3 and Day 1. The functional relevance of the neural correlates was then determined by using Pearson's correlation to test for a linear relationship between the mean discriminant score at the highest Az peaks and the magnitude of adaptive learning.

        <h3>IV. Key Findings</h3>
        <h4>Positive Feedback Functional Relevance:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The pre-feedback (C1 at -319 ms) and simultaneous feedback (C0 at 0 ms) correlates for correct trials were significantly and functionally relevant to adaptive learning on both Day 1 and Day 3 (p < 0.05).</li>
            <li>This suggests that as learning progresses, participants develop accurate internal predictions, and the brain appears to be updating beliefs and registering the outcome's significance at the time of feedback (0 ms).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Negative Feedback Conclusion:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>No neural correlates for negative (incorrect) feedback (I1, I0, I2) were found to be significantly correlated with the change in learning rate across any time point.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These findings suggest that the brain not only registers the outcome of a learning trial but also
            generates specific, distributed neural signals reflecting the accuracy of the decision, which
            are crucial for subsequent behavioral adjustments.

        <h3>V. Conclusion & Impact</h3>
        <p>
            The results provide strong evidence that whole-scalp neural correlates specific to positive feedback track the magnitude of adaptive learning. The lack of functional relevance for negative feedback correlates supports the hypothesis that its role is shifted towards monitoring or signaling a strategy change rather than directly governing the rate of learning adaptation, as is the case with positive feedback. This work validates the utility of multivariate whole-scalp analysis in providing comprehensive conclusions about the neural processes underlying reinforcement learning. Future work will focus on refining these correlates and exploring their causal roles using brain stimulation techniques.
