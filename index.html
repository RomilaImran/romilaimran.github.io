                    While the role of positive feedback in reinforcement learning (e.g., maintain strategy) is well-characterized, the exact function of negative (incorrect) feedback remains ambiguous, variously suggested to serve as performance monitoring, a signal for strategy change, or simply an inverted form of positive feedback. Resolving this ambiguity was a key goal. Second, existing research is limited by its heavy reliance on univariate Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), which overemphasize individual electrode activity and neglect complex, network-level brain processes that arise from several overlapping ERPs. Since learning is a dynamic and distributed task, this approach risks overlooking crucial signals. Therefore, the primary objective of this project was to overcome these methodological limitations by employing a **multivariate, whole-scalp approach** to identify distinct neural correlates for positive and negative feedback, and subsequently to correlate these specific neural signatures with the **change in the learning rate** to determine their functional relevance in adaptive learning.

                    The trial data utilized for this study was collected from **22 right-handed participants** (ages 18-29), who performed a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task over three consecutive days at the University of Leeds. The task required participants to differentiate between visual, auditory, and audiovisual stimuli (V, A, and AV) of either a car or a face. Each participant completed 216 trials daily, totaling 648 trials across the experiment. Stimulus clarity was systematically varied using low (32.5%) and high (37.6%) phase coherence, with immediate, valence-specific feedback (smiling or frowning cartoon scientist) provided upon response. Neural activity was recorded from **64 electrodes** placed according to the International 10-20 system at a 1000 Hz sampling rate, yielding a substantial total of **912,384 individual electrode recordings** across all participants and trials. To isolate the neural correlates of decision-making and feedback processing, the EEG data was **response-locked**, setting 0 ms to the simultaneous occurrence of the participant's keypress and the onset of feedback. The analysis subsequently focused on the **450 ms pre-response to 1000 ms post-response** window, utilizing only Day 1 and Day 3 data to maximize the contrast in learning progression.

                    Multivariate neural signatures were deduced using **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** classifiers, trained separately on correct and incorrect whole-scalp EEG activity to identify features best distinguishing between learning states on Day 1 and Day 3. The classifier worked by optimizing a hyperplane in sequential 70 ms time windows to maximize separation between the two days. The performance of this distinction was measured by the **Az score** (Area Under the ROC Curve); time points with high Az scores indicate a neural correlate where significant learning-related change occurred. The classifier's continuous output, the **discriminant score**, was extracted as the neural signature. These signatures were spatially interpreted using scalp maps derived from the classifier's weight vector (importance of each electrode) via **Haufe's transformation** over the **-450 ms pre-response to 1000 ms post-response** period.

                    To quantify the behavioral aspect of learning, a **Reinforcement Learning Drift-Diffusion Model (RLDDM)** was employed, which extends the standard DDM to include the impact of feedback (Q-learning) on future decisions. This model estimated the **learning rate** for each participant, a core parameter quantifying a participant's responsiveness to reward. The behavioral measure of adaptive learning was calculated as the **change in learning rate** between Day 3 and Day 1. The functional relevance of the neural correlates was then determined by using **Pearson's correlation** to test for a linear relationship between the mean **discriminant score** at the highest Az peaks and the magnitude of **adaptive learning** (change in learning rate).

        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the **Multivariate Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** of whole-scalp activity, four primary neural correlates (**Az scores**) were identified: **C1** (**-319** ms, pre-response correct), **I1** (**-409** ms, pre-response incorrect), **C2** (**391** ms, post-response correct), and **I2** (**581** ms, post-response incorrect), alongside signals at the feedback onset (**C0/I0** at 0 ms).
            
            Spatially, correct trials exhibited consistent and compact signals, transitioning from **occipital activity** at feedback onset (0 ms) to **frontoparietal regions** post-response (~ 150 to 950 ms). Conversely, incorrect trials yielded more diffused signals with notable **right-lateralized frontal activity** post-response, indicative of heightened frontal control and affective processing.
            
            When assessing functional relevance by correlating these signatures with the **change in the learning rate**, **positive feedback correlates (C1 and C0) proved highly relevant**, showing a significant correlation with the **change in learning rate (correct trials)** across both Day 1 and Day 3. This enduring correlation suggests that these signals, particularly the C1 and C0 activity which involves occipital regions and may reflect anticipatory prediction or confidence, actively **track adaptive learning progression**.
            
            The post-response correlate, C2, was only relevant on Day 1, suggesting it captures the initial, greater need for cognitive updating (a P3b-like response) that diminishes as learning becomes automated. Crucially, none of the **incorrect feedback correlates (I1, I0, I2) showed a significant linear correlation** with the **change in learning rate (incorrect trials)**, implying they do not linearly track the magnitude of learning adaptation, despite their distinct spatial patterns (e.g., right frontal/parietal activity) suggesting systemic involvement in attention and conflict monitoring.
