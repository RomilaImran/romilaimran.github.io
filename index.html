        <h1>Investigating Whole-scalp Accuracy-specific Neural Correlates Underlying Reinforcement Learning</h1>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            This project delves into the intricate neural mechanisms that underpin reinforcement learning processes,
            specifically examining how accuracy-related signals manifest across the entire scalp. Using advanced
            neuroimaging techniques, we aim to identify and characterize the specific brain activities that correlate
            with successful and unsuccessful learning outcomes.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            Our approach combines sophisticated behavioral tasks with whole-scalp neuroimaging data acquisition.
            Participants engaged in a custom-designed reinforcement learning paradigm where their decisions
            yielded distinct accuracy feedback. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was recorded simultaneously
            to capture high temporal resolution neural activity.

            Advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques were then applied to the raw EEG data
            to extract relevant neural correlates. Special attention was paid to components associated with
            feedback processing and decision-making.

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Preliminary results indicate distinct patterns of neural activation following accurate versus
            inaccurate responses. We observed significant differences in power spectral densities and
            event-related potentials (ERPs) across specific scalp regions, particularly in areas associated
            with cognitive control and reward processing.

            These findings suggest that the brain not only registers the outcome of a learning trial but also
            generates specific, distributed neural signals reflecting the accuracy of the decision, which
            are crucial for subsequent behavioral adjustments.

        <h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            This investigation provides novel insights into the neural underpinnings of reinforcement learning,
            highlighting the whole-scalp dynamics of accuracy-specific neural correlates. Future work will
            focus on refining these correlates and exploring their causal roles using brain stimulation techniques.
